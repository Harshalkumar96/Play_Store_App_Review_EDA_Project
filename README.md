# Play_Store_App_Review_EDA_Project

#### INTRODUCTION

The Google Play Store is flooded with a vast array of applications, with millions being launched on the platform on a regular basis. Numerous designers and developers put in countless hours of effort to make their apps stand out and succeed on the Play Store. However, in this highly competitive environment, it can be an enormous challenge for developers to determine whether they are focusing on the right path to achieve success on the platform.

To make their mark in this overcrowded market and establish a distinct identity, developers need to ensure that they incorporate the essential factors that are critical to the customer's decision-making process while designing and developing an app. Unfortunately, the lack of a clear understanding of the inner workings and dynamics of popular app markets can adversely impact both developers and users

#### OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this exploratory data analysis project is to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize their product on the Play Store. our mission is to study current trends and insights of Play Store. We were given with two datasets i.e., Play Store & User Reviews. Before jumping into the data's provided, let me first explain you about the EDA analysis.

#### PROBLEM STATEMENTS

1.What are the top categories on Play Store? 

2.Are majority of the apps Paid or Free? 

3.How importance is the rating of the application? 

4.Which categories from the audience should the app be based on? 

5.Which category has the most no. of installations? 

6.How does the count of apps varies by Genres? 

7.How does the last update has an effect on the rating? 

8.How are ratings affected when the app is a paid one? 

9.How are reviews and ratings co-related? 

10.Lets us discuss the sentiment subjectivity. 

11.Is subjectivity and polarity proportional to each other? 

12.What is the percentage of review sentiments? 

13.How is sentiment polarity varying for paid and free apps? 

14.What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Data scientists utilize exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine and scrutinize data sets for patterns, outliers, and anomalies, as well as to generate hypotheses based on their understanding of the data. EDA is a crucial component of any data analysis or data science project, as it aids in determining the most effective methods for manipulating data sources to obtain the necessary answers.
The process of EDA includes generating summary statistics for numerical data within the dataset and utilizing various data visualization techniques to better comprehend the data, thereby making it more attractive and appealing. By utilizing EDA, data scientists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data they are working with, and use this knowledge to make informed decisions about subsequent data analysis steps.

The following are the various steps involved in the EDA process:

1.Problem Statement - We shall brainstorm and understand the given data set. We shall study the attributes present in it and try to do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem. 

2.Hypothesis - Upon studying the attributes present in the data base, we shall develop some basic hypothesis on which we can work and play with the data to look for the varied results which we can get out of it. 

3.Univariate Analysis - It is the simplest form of analyzing the data. In this we would initially pick up a single attribute and study it in and out. It doesn't deal with any sort of co-relation and it's major purpose is to describe. It takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data. 

4.Bivariate Analysis - This analysis is related to cause and the relationship between the two attributes. We will try to understand the dependency of attributes on each other. 

5.Multivariate Analysis - This is done when more than two variables have to be analyzed simultaneously. 

6.Data Cleaning - We shall clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables. 

7.Testing Hypothesis - We shall check if our data meets the assumptions required by most of the multivariate techniques.
